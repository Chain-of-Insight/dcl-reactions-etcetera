## Stage 1: Unreliable Alchemizer (Chemistry)

- Follow the Alchemist's instructions and collect the correct minerals by mining them from random spawn points in the environment. 

- Mining is achieved by clicking on a mineral. The first click will reduce the mineral's size and the second click will remove the mineral from the environment and add it to your inventory

- Once you've determined the correct set of 3 minerals to place in the alchemizer, there is a 50% chance of producing a successful alchemy. Because of this randomness, even if you're sure about the minerals you need, it may take a few tries to achieve a successful alchemize.

- There are 8 minerals in total and, while rare, it's possible for 1 mineral to be in a difficult to reach position. If you are having trouble finding a specific mineral you can refresh the spawn points for all minerals by forcing a failed alchemize.

- Once you have produced a successful alchemy event you'll have everything that you need to unlock the door to stage 2

## Stage 2: Incredible Machine (Physics)

*Keywords: Physics, battle mechanics, visuospatial*

- Follow the Physicist's instructions and correctly configure the alignment, velocity and distance for 4 turret cannons. Correct turret configurations are randomized at item spawn, so the answer is different each time the player encounters the puzzle.

- Each turret has a target, platform, 2 switches (each with 2 possible switch positions) and a plant. Switch behaviours will vary for turret to turret, but 1 switch always controls the turret's distance between itself and its target. The other switch controls either projectile velocity or cannon angle.

- The cannon game makes use of our own custom physics engine to power the ball flight, gravity effects and bouncing. Pretty crazy.
